      <p>I’m Matt, a <s>designer</s> <s>web designer</s> <s>front-end developer</s> <s>front-end designer</s> <s>UI/UX developer</s> <s>gf!bf&uh!jk@hj&3&h*</s></p>
      <p>Let’s just go with “designer.”</p>

  <div class="hp-top__body">
      <p>I’m a specialized generalist, using code as a tool for bringing designs to life in the browser. With a background ranging from <a href="http://www.landesbergdesign.com">print design</a> to <a href="http://www.maya.com">user experience</a> to <a href="http://www.cgpartnersllc.com">front-end development</a>, I now spend most of my time creating design systems, digital interfaces, and online publications.</p>

      <p>I’m currently a Staff Product Designer at <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a>, focusing on design engineering for the App and Theme Stores. I maintain our design system in both Figma and code, bridge the gap between the UX and engineering teams, and ensure that new merchant features are shipped at the highest quality.</p>

      <p>I previously worked as a Senior Designer at <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a>, where I was part of the small team that designed, built, and maintained the marketing presence of the world’s largest open source platform. Prior to that, I was Design Lead of Release Team at <a href="https://www.upstatement.com">Upstatement</a>, focusing on the long-term evolution of sites for clients with limited in-house digital teams.</p>

      <p>If you’d like to chat about bocce technique, neighborhood bears, the finer points of making homemade pierogi, or (if you must) all things design and development, don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:matthewleedesign@gmail.com">say hello</a>.</p>
